This can be done as following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gemirro index\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nLast, launch the `TCPServer`, and all requests will check if gems are detected, and download them if necessary and generate index immediately.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gemirro server\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a custom configuration file not located in the current directory, use the `-c` or `--config` option.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Apache configuration\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n##Nginx configuration\r\nTODO\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
